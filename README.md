# Code Samples
Samples of my work from jobs and classes.
## c
- These files are from a college C course in 2012.
  - The .c files each contain the algorithm described at the top of the file.
  - The BankProject directory contains a client/server banking application made with a class partner. There is a PDF inside explaining it in more detail.

## drupal
- ha_core is a custom module to setup the HA Lighting website and provide it with a Note custom entity type.
  - HA Lighting is a client site I work on for my part-time Drupal job.
  - All code related to the Note custom entity type is my contribution, along with the initial creation of the module, install functions, and most hooks.
- Contributed a patch for the Google Store Locator module. Created two versions of the patch for different versions of the module. They can be seen [here](https://www.drupal.org/node/2640696).
